It appears as though hours per week are stacked around the typical 40-hour value, and that this value of weekly hours dominates regardless of the level of education.

Is there something that, on the contrary, satisfies your intuition, thereby providing a 'sanity check'?

The decrease in probability of working over 65 hours a week when an individual has a lower level of education could indicate that the more advanced the job is the more demand there is for the individual to work, and potentially work harder. It also shows that most individuals have low capital gains and that aligns with my previous belief that most individuals may not have significant capital gains and that the distribution is positively skewed. If I felt there were red flags in the data I would do further analysis to validate what I found as well as check additional data sources. I would also check the ethics,representativeness, and quality of the data set to make sure it is representative of the population and does not have multiple missing values."
